# ML-miniproject

we implement all the source code with python and using jupyter notebook to run, so that you do not have to install all the included libaries.

if you want to run the source codes, please use jupyter notebook, some of them may takes much time if runned in another
platform.

Note that rerun the source codes for data preprocessing (data_preprocessing.jpynb) is not recommended because it envolves randomizing and shuffling the dataset, that might result in different performance in the trained models.
